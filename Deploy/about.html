                    <h2>Our Mission</h2>
                    <p>Grace.AI exists to help young adults navigate Scripture with theological depth and practical application. Through AI-powered biblical insights, we aim to bridge the gap between Reformed theology and the complex questions facing college students and young professionals today.</p>

                    <h2>The Story Behind Grace.AI</h2>
                    <p>Hi, I'm Jack Bone, a student at Baylor University. Like many in my generation, I grew up in the church but found myself wrestling with deeper theological questions as I entered college.</p>
                    
                    <p>When AI began transforming every industry, I realized we had a choice: hop on the train or get left behind. As someone with zero coding experience, I decided to dive in and see what was possible when you combine human curiosity with artificial intelligence.</p>
                    
                    <p>That's when I noticed a gap. There were AI tools for everything—writing, business, creativity—but very few specifically designed to help young adults explore Scripture with theological depth. I saw friends struggling to find reliable biblical resources that spoke to our generation's questions about faith, purpose, and calling.</p>
                    
                    <p>Grace.AI is my experiment in bridging that gap. It's proof that you don't need to be a programmer to build something meaningful—you just need to identify a real need and be willing to learn. My hope is that this platform helps other young adults navigate Scripture with the same rigor and accessibility that AI brings to every other area of life.</p>
                    
                    <p>This is what one guy can accomplish by leveraging AI, asking the right questions, and believing that Scripture has answers worth sharing with the next generation.</p>

                    <h2>Theological Foundation</h2>
                    <p>Our responses are grounded in Reformed theology, emphasizing:</p>

                        <li><strong>Grace Alone</strong> — Salvation is entirely God's work, not ours</li>
                        <li><strong>Biblical Truth</strong> — Applying God's unchanging Word to today's challenges</li>
